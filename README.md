# Bus_Logger_Application

This is a Windows Forms application I developed in 2023 as part of my Grade 12 school project. The Bus Logger Application is designed to help users efficiently log and manage bus schedule data. It features data entry forms, XML-based storage for persistence, and functionality to retrieve and display stored records.

The project helped me gain hands-on experience with:

- C# programming and WinForms UI design  
- Working with XML files for data storage and retrieval  
- Application debugging and user input validation  
- Practical understanding of software development lifecycle in a real-world context

This application was a great learning opportunity that laid the foundation for my current software development skills.
