# Bus_Logger_Application

This is a Windows Forms application I developed in 2023 as part of my Grade 12 school project. The **Bus Logger Application** is designed to help users efficiently log and manage bus schedule data. It features data entry forms, XML-based storage for persistence, and functionality to retrieve and display stored records.
